\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Draw lines through orthogonally adjacent cells to form a directional loop.

1. All unshaded cells must be visited.

2. The loop cannot branch off or cross itself.

3. Each time the loop exits a region containing a number, its visit to the next region must consist of exactly that number of cells.
\end{markdown}
