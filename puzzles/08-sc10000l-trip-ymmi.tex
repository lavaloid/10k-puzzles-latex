\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Place some 1x2 beds in the grid, each with a pillow on one side and shade all of the remaining empty cells. All shaded cells form one orthogonally connected area. No 2x2 region may be entirely shaded. Each bed must be orthogonally touching the group of shaded cells. Beds may not overlap each other or shaded cells. Cells with clues cannot be shaded or contain beds. A clue indicates the number of pillows appearing in cells orthogonally adjacent to it. A vertically oriented bed must have its pillow on its bottom half.
