\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Normal 6x6 sudoku rules apply.

Each letter represents a different number from 1-9. Clues outside the grid give the sum of the first X cells in that direction, where X is the first cell seen from that direction. A cell with a letter must contain its associated digit.
