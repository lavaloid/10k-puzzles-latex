\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Akari rules:

Place lights in some empty cells so that every non-black cell is illuminated.

1(a). Lights illuminate the cell theyâ€™re in as well as all cells seen in a straight line horizontally or vertically, not obstructed by a black cell.

1(b). Light does not bend around the edges of 3d surfaces, but can travel across gaps to reach other surfaces.

2. Lights may not illuminate each other.

3. Clues represent the number of lights in the (up to) four orthogonal cells surrounding the clue.

4. Clues in black squares can see all orthogonally adjacent squares not separated by a gap



Note:  only white cells in the outlined regions need to be illuminated.
