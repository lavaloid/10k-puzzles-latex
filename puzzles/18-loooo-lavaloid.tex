\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
*Skyscraper:* Place a number from 1 to N into each cell so that each row and column contains every number from that range with no repeats, where N is the side length of the grid. A clue outside the grid represents how many cells in the corresponding row or column contain a larger number than all cells before it in that row or column from the direction of the clue.



*Renban:* Digits along the given lines must form a non-repeating consecutive group of numbers in any order. Some of the digits may be outside the grid, where they behave as skyscrapers clues.



**Solving note:** For answer check, fill in all cells with cages.
