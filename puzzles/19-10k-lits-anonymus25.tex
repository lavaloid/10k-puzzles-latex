Fun fact: This puzzle was originally intended to be easier than it is. However, I made a logical leap in the creation process, so a deduction that I wanted to happen got lost, and got replaced with a much harder one. Somehow it's still unique though!

\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Shade some cells such that each region conatins exactly 1 tetromino (a shape consisting of 4 shaded cells.) All shaded cells must be connected orthogonally, and no 2x2 can be completely shaded (so there can't be an O tetromino). Two different tetrominoes touching each other must be of a  completely different type.
