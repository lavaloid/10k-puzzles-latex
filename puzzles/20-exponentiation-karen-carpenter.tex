\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Standard Evolmino rules apply: Place squares into some white cells such that exactly one square in each orthogonally connected group of squares is on part of an arrow. Each arrow must pass through at least two different groups of squares. Each group of squares must be exactly the same shape as the one that came before it on the same arrow (if it exists), without rotation or reflection, plus one additional square.
\end{markdown}
