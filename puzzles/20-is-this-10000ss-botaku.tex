\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Usual Heyawake rules apply: shade some cells so that no two shaded cells are orthogonally adjacent and the remaining unshaded cells form one orthogonally connected area. Numbered regions must contain the indicated amount of shaded cells. A line of consecutive unshaded cells may not cross more than one bold border.
\end{markdown}
