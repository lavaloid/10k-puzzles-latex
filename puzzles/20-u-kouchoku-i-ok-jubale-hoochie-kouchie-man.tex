\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Draw lines between every node to form a loop.



1. Lines go straight from node to node, and can be drawn at any angle.



2. The loop can not branch off. Nodes must be visited exactly once.



3. The loop may intersect itself if the two lines meet at a right angle (90°), and there is not a node at the intersection.



4. All clues containing the same letter must be connected consecutively.



5. Clues containing different letters may not be directly connected; the loop must travel through at least one unmarked node between them.
