\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Normal sudoku rules apply.

Adjusted Japanese sums rules apply.



Normal Japanese Sums: The clues outside the grid indicate the sums of the contiguous runs found in that row or column that must be shaded. There must be an unshaded cell between runs of the same color. If a row or column is unclued, there is no shading in that row or column.



Adjusted -- any digit could represent a sandwich clue instead! (that is, the sum of the digits between the 1 and 9 where the 1, 9, and all the digits in between are shaded).
