\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Draw paths along the grid lines connecting pairs of circles such that all circles form one connected network. Paths may not cross each other or themselves, and a path may not turn more than once. A number in a circle indicates how many paths are connected to it. Two identical numbers cannot be connected directly.

**Variant**: All empty circles have the same number, which must be determined.
