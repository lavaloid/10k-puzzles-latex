\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Shade some cells so that all areas of orthogonally connected unshaded cells are rectangular and all areas of orthogonally connected shaded cells are not rectangular. The unshaded rectangles must all be connected diagonally. Clues cannot be shaded, and represent the number of cells in the unshaded area they belong to. An unshaded area of cells cannot contain more than one clue. No 2x2 region may be entirely shaded.
