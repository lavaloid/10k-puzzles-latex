\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Chaos Construction (6x6): Divide the grid into regions, each consisting of six orthogonally connected cells. Each row, column and region must contain the digits 1-6 once each.



X-Sums: Clues outside the grid show the sum of the first X cells in the corresponding row/column, where X is the digit in the cell nearest to the clue. In addition, the first X cells in this row/column are part of the same region, and the X+1th cell is part of a different region. ? clues can stand for any positive integer.
