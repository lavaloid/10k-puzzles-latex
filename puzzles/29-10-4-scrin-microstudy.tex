\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Shade some cells so that each orthogonally connected area of shaded cells is in the shape of a rectangle. The shaded rectangles must all form a single loop through diagonal connections, with no branches. All cells with circles must be shaded, and if a circle contains a number, its shaded rectangle must contain the indicated number of cells.
