\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Shade a single group of orthogonally connected cells in each region. Shaded groups may not share a bold border. Regions with numbers must contain the indicated amount of shaded cells. If all of the shaded groups were to fall straight down without changing shape, they must completely fill the bottom half of the grid.
\end{markdown}
