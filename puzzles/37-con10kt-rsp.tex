Normal Context rules apply:



Shade some cells so that no two shaded cells are orthogonally adjacent and the remaining unshaded cells form one orthogonally connected area. An unshaded clue indicates the number of orthogonally adjacent shaded cells. A shaded clue indicates the number of diagonally adjacent shaded cells.
