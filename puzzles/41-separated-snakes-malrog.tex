\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Divide the grid into regions, each of which is a 1-cell-wide snake of connected cells that may touch itself diagonally but not orthogonally. Each region must contain exactly one circle, which may contain a number. If there is a number, it indicates the area of the snake which must be at least 1. No two snakes of the same area may touch orthogonally.
