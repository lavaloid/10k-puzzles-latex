\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Place some of the shapes from the shape bank below (you can rotate but __not__ reflect the shapes) into the grid so that no two shapes touch one another, not even diagonally. Clued cells cannot be shaded, and contain arrows indicating all of the orthogonal directions in which a shaded cell appears closest to the clued cell. At least one shaded cell must appear in the direction of an arrow.
\end{markdown}
