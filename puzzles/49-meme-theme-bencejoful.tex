\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Draw a path through the centers of some cells, entering the grid at the “IN” marking and exiting at the “OUT” marking. All non-icy cells must be visited. Two perpendicular line segments may intersect each other only on icy cells, but they may not turn at their intersection or otherwise overlap. The path may not turn on icy cells.
