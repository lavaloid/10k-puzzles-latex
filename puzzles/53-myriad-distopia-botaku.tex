\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Place some pentominoes from the bank given outside the grid into the grid so that no pentominoes touch one another, not even diagonally. Rotating and reflecting pentominoes is allowed. Clued cells cannot be used by a pentomino, and indicate the sum of the distances (measured from centre to centre) to the first cell used by a pentomino in all of the orthogonal directions in which a used cell appears closest to the clued cell.
