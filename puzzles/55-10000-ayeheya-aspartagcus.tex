Shade some cells so that no two shaded cells are orthogonally adjacent and the remaining unshaded cells form one orthogonally connected area. Numbered regions must contain the indicated amount of shaded cells. The shaded cells within a region must have 180° rotational symmetry around the region’s center. A line of consecutive unshaded cells may not cross more than one bold border.
