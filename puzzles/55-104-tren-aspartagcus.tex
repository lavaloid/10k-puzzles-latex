\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{markdown}
Locate some blocks in the grid, each of which are either 1x2 or 1x3, which may not overlap each other. Each clue must be used by a block and each block must contain exactly one clue, the value of which represents how many different locations to which the block can be moved by sliding it in the direction of its short end without overlapping another block or going out of the grid. Staying stationary does not count as one of these locations.
